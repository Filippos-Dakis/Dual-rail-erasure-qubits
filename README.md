# Dual-rail erasure qubits
This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks that reproduce the results and figures from the paper [Dynamical error reshaping for dual-rail erasure qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08416). It also includes two ``.csv`` files with the experimentally friendly pulse shapes derived in the paper.

# Abstract
Erasure qubits -- qubits designed to have an error profile that is dominated by detectable leakage errors -- are a promising way to cut down the resources needed for quantum error correction. There have been several recent experiments demonstrating erasure qubits in superconducting quantum processors, most notably the dual-rail qubit defined by the one-photon subspace of two coupled cavities. An outstanding challenge is that the ancillary transmons needed to facilitate erasure checks and two-qubit gates introduce a substantial amount of noise, limiting the benefits of working with erasure-biased qubits. Here, we show how to suppress the adverse effects of transmon-induced noise while performing erasure checks or two-qubit gates. We present control schemes for these operations that suppress erasure check errors by two orders of magnitude and reduce the logical two-qubit gate infidelities by up to three orders of magnitude.
